<p><h1><u><center>PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE</u></center></h1></p>
<p><font color="blue">A programming language is a formal computer language or constructed language designed to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs to control the behavior of a machine or to express algorithms.</font></p>

<p><h3><u><center>JAVA</u></center></h3></p>
<p> <font color="blue">Java is an object-oriented language similar to C++, but simplified to eliminate language features that cause common programming errors. Java source code files (files with a .java extension) are compiled into a format called bytecode (files with a .class extension), which can then be executed by a Java interpreter.</font></p>

<p><h3><u><center>O<sub>2 and life</sub></u></center></h3></p>
<p><font color="blue">Oxygen is one of the most essential requirements of life, without which organisms on Earth would not survive. Living organisms generate energy from food through the process of respiration. This allows humans and other organisms to perform their daily tasks. Improper metabolism weakens the cells and causes them to lose natural immunity, making them susceptible to viruses that may lead to fatal health conditions.</font></p>
