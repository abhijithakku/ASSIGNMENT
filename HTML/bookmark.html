<h2><a name="computer">COMPUTER</a></h2>
<p>A computer is a machine (mostly electronic) that is able to take information (input), do some work on or make changes to the information (process), to make new information (output). Computers have existed for much of human history. Examples of early computers are the astrolabe and the abacus. There are four main processing steps in a computer, and they are: inputting, outputting, storage and processing.

Modern computers are very different from early computers. They can do billions of calculations per second. Most people have used a personal computer in their home or at work. Computers do many different jobs where automation is useful. Some examples are controlling traffic lights, vehicle computers, security systems, washing machines and digital televisions.

A computer user can control it by a user interface. Input devices include keyboard, mouse, buttons, touch screen. Some very new computers can also be controlled with voice commands or hand gestures or even brain signals through electrodes implanted in the brain or along nerves.</p>
<p><h4><a name="CPU">CPU</h4></p>
<p>A central processing unit (CPU) is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logical, control and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions.</p>
<p><h4><a name="ALU">ALU</h4></p>
<p>An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a combinational digital electronic circuit that performs arithmetic and bitwise operations on integer binary numbers. This is in contrast to a floating-point unit (FPU), which operates on floating point numbers. An ALU is a fundamental building block of many types of computing circuits, including the central processing unit (CPU) of computers, FPUs, and graphics processing units (GPUs). A single CPU, FPU or GPU may contain multiple ALUs.

The inputs to an ALU are the data to be operated on, called operands, and a code indicating the operation to be performed and, optionally, status information from a previous operation; the ALU's output is the result of the performed operation. In many designs, the ALU also exchanges additional information with a status register, which relates to the result of the current or previous operations.</p>

<p><h2><a name="pro"> PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE</h2></a></p>
<p><h4><a name="C">C</h4></p>
<p>C is a general-purpose programming language used for wide range of applications from Operating systems like Windows and iOS to software that is used for creating 3D movies.

C programming is highly efficient. That’s the main reason why it’s very popular despite being more than 40 years old.

Standard C programs are portable. The source code written in one system works in another operating system without any change.

As mentioned, it’s a good language to start learning programming. If you know C programming, you will not just understand how your program works, but you will also be able to create a mental picture on how a computer works.</p>
<p><h4><a name="c++">C<sup>++</sup></h4></p>
<p>C++ (pronounced cee plus plus, /ˈsiː plʌs plʌs/) is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation.

It was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained and large systems, with performance, efficiency and flexibility of use as its design highlights.[5] C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications,[5] including desktop applications, servers (e.g. e-commerce, web search or SQL servers), and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes).[6] C++ is a compiled language, with implementations of it available on many platforms and provided by various organizations, including the Free Software Foundation (FSF's GCC), LLVM, Microsoft, Intel and IBM.

C++ is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), with the latest standard version ratified and published by ISO in December 2014 as ISO/IEC 14882:2014 (informally known as C++14).[7] The C++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998 as ISO/IEC 14882:1998, which was then amended by the C++03, ISO/IEC 14882:2003, standard. The current C++14 standard supersedes these and C++11, with new features and an enlarged standard library. Before the initial standardization in 1998, C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979, as an extension of the C language as he wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C, which also provided high-level features for program organization.

Many other programming languages have been influenced by C++, including C#, D, Java, and newer versions of C (after 1998).</p>

<p><h2><a name="DBMS"> DBMS</h2></p>
<p><h4><a name="RDBMS">RDBMS</h4></p>
<p>A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a database management system (DBMS) that is based on the relational model as invented by E. F. Codd, of IBM's San Jose Research Laboratory. In 2016, many of the databases in widespread use are based on the relational database model.

RDBMSs have been a common choice for the storage of information in new databases used for financial records, manufacturing and logistical information, personnel data, and other applications since the 1980s. Relational databases have often replaced legacy hierarchical databases and network databases because they are easier to understand and use. However, relational databases have received unsuccessful challenge attempts by object database management systems in the 1980s and 1990s (which were introduced trying to address the so-called object-relational impedance mismatch between relational databases and object-oriented application programs) and also by XML database management systems in the 1990s.[citation needed] Despite such attempts, RDBMSs keep most of the market share, which has also grown over the years.</p>
<p><h4><a name="OODBMS">OODBMS</h4></p>
<p>An object-oriented database management system (OODBMS), sometimes shortened to ODBMS for object database management system), is a database management system (DBMS) that supports the modelling and creation of data as objects. This includes some kind of support for classes of objects and the inheritance of class properties and methods by subclasses and their objects. There is currently no widely agreed-upon standard for what constitutes an OODBMS, and OODBMS products are considered to be still in their infancy. In the meantime, the object-relational database management system (ORDBMS), the idea that object-oriented database concepts can be superimposed on relational databases, is more commonly encountered in available products. An object-oriented database interface standard is being developed by an industry group, the Object Data Management Group (ODMG). The Object Management Group (OMG) has already standardized an object-oriented data brokering interface between systems in a network.</p>
<p><h4><a name="HDBMS">HDBMS</h4></p>
<p>A DBMS is said to be hierarchical DBMS, when the data is organized like a tree structure. That means, it simply represents the data using parent – child relationship. It is the oldest style of organizing/storing data and still some organizations are using this.

It follows one to many relationship. i.e. All parents can have more than one child, but each child should have only one parent.

All the records will be organized as per the relation between them. The parent record at the top of the tree structure is called the Root record. This parent record will be linked to all the related child records and each child record will be linked to a parent. In this type of DBMS, there is a drawback. If we want to add a new field or record, it may require to redefine the entire database in some cases.

XML document is the best example for hierarchical DBMS.</p>
<p><h4><a name="NWDBMS">NWBMS</h4></p>
<p>The acronym NWDBMS has a life path number 3. The life path number three implies that you posses numerous abilities and have a positive nature with an awesome readiness to learn.

These qualities are supplementary and result in amazing vitality that is coupled with positive emotions. You feel great in gatherings of big crowds and want to appreciate life. In the event that there are negative focuses or challenges throughout your life, attempt to overcome them, without getting discouraged over them in a considerable measure of self centeredness. Always connecting with others in an energetic style can motivate people around you and create a positive impact.

Your desire is mostly pointed to create cash and material means. Exotic joys are a genuine enjoyment of life for you.

Be it great nourishment, chic attire, sports autos, a wonderful and agreeable home or great music. Friends know you as a social individual and appreciate your sincere way of being. On the off chance that you work as a host or as a cook, this will dependably be a win. Having aced the craft of verbal communication helps you to be a great and adaptable performer. In the event that others don't feel great</p>
